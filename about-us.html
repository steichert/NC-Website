                        <p style="margin-top: 4%;">New Creation was founded in the early 1980's by Ron and Ann Robinson after they returned from the UK
                            with a vision to plant a New Testament church. The charismatic renewal was at its height in South Africa,
                            and there was growing interest in house churches, Apostolic Team and body ministry. Against this background,
                            New Creation started in their home, and as it grew, moved to a variety of rented venues,
                            eventually settling in the Parkhurst Recreation Centre. By 1984, we had pioneered a Christian School.
                            In 1987, God released the current property in Robin Hills, Randburg, and the church and school
                            relocated there, continuing to grow and flourish.

                        <p>The heart of New Creation Family Church is reflected in the following values.
                            They are the foundation for what we do and how we do it.
                            While our methods and ways of doing things change from time to time,
                            these values are non-negotiable.

                                We believe that the church is first about Jesus,
                                who is her head. The church is both world-wide and local. As individuals and as a corporate whole,
                                we are called to total commitment to the Lordship of Christ, to live sacrificial lives
                                enabled by the Holy Spirit, dedicating time, energy, material resources,
                                gifts and talents for our Master's use. Our worship is a lifestyle of obedience to God
                                rather than only a special activity at corporate celebrations.

                                Church is built around the concept of 'family' rather than 'institution'.
                                Fatherhood, motherhood, and familial relationships are, therefore, at the core of who we are
                                becoming as a local expression of God's extended family. This family welcomes and embraces
                                Christ-followers, and any who are interested in him, from all economic backgrounds, etc.
                                In fact, in doing so, we seek to understand and represent the multi-faceted nature of
                                God's rich grace and love. we are learning to be reconciled to God through Christ
                                also means reconcilation at its deepest level with one another, and that celebrating and
                                transcending our differences as well as our similarities helps us to more accurately experience
                                as well as demonstrate who God is. Since all family begins with nuclear family
                                in all of its many incarnations, we place a high value on strengthening parents and children,
                                and minstering to brokenness and hurt in fmaily life. Since we are only a small part of God's
                                vast family, we seek to relate and to learn from a variety of church expressions and flows.

                                We would like to be a "what you see is what you get" community, in which authenticity in
                                life and relationships is the hallmark factor. We consider honesty, transparency, and
                                integrity to be vital characteristics of shared life in Christ, while trying to avoid
                                pretense and insincerity. We are on a journey together, increasingly discovering
                                what it means to live as God's people in the midst of the joys and sorrows of life.
                                As such, we do not have all the answers, or even understand all of the questions,
                                but we are genuinely seeking how to more faithfully embody God's purposes. Mutual and
                                genuine love, encouragement, and accountability are important to us along the path.

                                We believe that God's mission is to extend His kingdom rule into every area of human
                                experience. Our relationships, jobs, and mudane lives, therefore, are arenas in which
                                God calls and empowers us to represent and extend his kingdom. "Secular" and "sacred"
                                categories are false dichotomies which in Christ, are subordinate into his purposes.
                                We are individually and corporately to live and work in ways which influence society
                                around us with God's grace, life, and love. Our desire as a church family is to strenghten
                                and equip each person to live in this way, rather than to place church over and against
                                daily life.

                                One of the most powerful metaphors for church life in scripture is that of the body.
                                Church is an organic, rather than an organizational, entity. Every person who is in Christ
                                has been gifted and empowered to serve as a part of this body in relationship with others.
                                When each part does its work, the whole body grows and becomes healthy.
                                Because Christ is the head of the body, other roles and functions are just that - we do
                                not emphasise position and title, but function and gifting. Team is an important concept
                                for us, and we resist attempts within and outside of oursleves to elevate and one gifting
                                or role unduly above others. Scripture and authority support the body with the ability to
                                move and accomplish God-given tasks, but should not overwhlem it or be starlkly visible.
                                Leadership is expressed more through fatherhood and motherhood than through corporate
                                structuring. Becuase the church is a body, God places each person where he wants them to
                                be and each becomes an integral part of the health and life of that body.

                                        Since the fall of our first "parents," Adam and Eve, Man is entirely unable in
                                        his own strength or ability to find salvation and reconciliation with God. Man
                                        is wholly dependent on God's grace and mercy. Romans 5:12-14; Ephesians 2:8
                                        Salvation comes by God's grace, not by works. It depends upon repentance, faith
                                        in God through accepting the lordship and saving act of Jesus Christ, the
                                        cleansing by the shed blood of Jesus and the regeneration by the Holy Spirit.

                                        and that nothing less than the Lordship of Christ upon a life is the mark of a

                                        of service. Ephesians 4:11-13 It is the commission of the Church to go into the
                                        whole world to preach the gospel and extend the Kingdom of God, knowing that

                                        to all nations, and then shall the end come." Matthew 24:14; 28:18-20 Instituted
                                        by Jesus with His disciples, the Lord's Supper is to be continued in the Church,
                                        and in doing so, the she "proclaims the Lord's death until He comes," serving as

                                        Through the celebration, we discern and acknowledge the Body of Christ in its

                                Church of the Nations International (COTN) began as a seed that was planted in the hearts
                                of Tony and Marilyn Fitzgerald, originally from Tasmania, during a prayer time in Argentina
                                in 1978. That seed housed the God-given passion to win, train and send people to places
                                where the hurting would be healed, the captives freed and lives restored to live in the
                                destiny God had purposed for them. Through the planting and establishing of local churches,
                                life-giving ministry hubs, or Resource Hubs, would serve this need around the world and
                                facilitate multiplication within God's kingdom.

                            COTN is not a denomination, but a family of churches built on spiritual parenting and relationship.
                            Churches relate to the wider whole through forming apostolic clusters, which are served by an
                            Apostolic Council.New Creation is a part of Tony and Marilyn's cluster, and forms a sub-cluster
                            along with other Gauteng churches.

                            We believe that the Biblical model of leadership is servant and team oriented.
                            We also believe that true leadership is more about character and influence than it is
                            about position.

                            Our ethos is one of "every member involvement" - there are no professionals and no super-stars

                            as a body made up of different but valuable parts (1 Cor 12 & 14), each of which contributes
                            to the well-being of the whole as the Lord gives grace. So, if God has brought you here and
                            planted you for this season in this house, throw yourself in with all you have and get involved!
                            Be a channel of the Spirit's life!

                            <p>New Creation was born out of the Restoration/house church movement of the United Kingdom
                                in the late 70's/early 80's (not the same as the North American Restoration movement).

                            <p>
                                Yes - we believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit as normative
                                for all believers today. We are, however, not "hyper-charismatic," and believe that the
                                Spirit's gifts are primarily for everyday life, and not just a special time during a
                                celebration service. Our main concern is that we are all growing in our love for God and
                                one another, our commitment to Christ, and our concern for a lost world. We acknowledge
                                that these things require the activity of the Spirit in our midst.
